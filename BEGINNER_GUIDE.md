# Beginner's Guide - Getting Started

This guide assumes you're new to Docker and APIs. Follow these steps exactly!

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need First

1. **Docker Desktop** - Download and install from:
   - Windows: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Mac: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Linux: Already have it!

2. **A text editor** - Any will work:
   - VS Code (recommended): https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Notepad++ (Windows)
   - TextEdit (Mac)

3. **A terminal/command prompt**
   - Windows: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - Mac: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter
   - Linux: You know this already!

4. **Google Gemini API Key** (FREE):
   - Go to: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
   - Sign in with Google account
   - Click "Create API Key"
   - Copy it somewhere safe

---

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Terminal and Navigate to Project

```bash
# Go to the project folder
cd /tmp/cc-agent/58088597/project

# Check you're in the right place (should show files)
ls
```

You should see: `README.md`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.

---

### Step 2: Add Your Gemini API Key

Open the `.env` file in your text editor:

```bash
# If you have VS Code
code .env

# Or use nano (Linux/Mac)
nano .env

# Or use notepad (Windows)
notepad .env
```

**Find this line:**
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

**Replace it with your actual key:**
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyABC123...your-key-here
```

**Save and close the file.**

---

### Step 3: Start Docker Desktop

1. Open Docker Desktop application
2. Wait until it says "Docker Desktop is running"
3. Leave it open in the background

---

### Step 4: Start All Services

In your terminal, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Download necessary software (first time only, takes 5-10 minutes)
- Start 5 services
- Set up the database

**What you'll see:**
```
[+] Running 5/5
‚úî Container academic_postgres  Started
‚úî Container academic_redis     Started
‚úî Container academic_n8n       Started
‚úî Container academic_backend   Started
‚úî Container academic_pgadmin   Started
```

---

### Step 5: Wait for Services to Start (IMPORTANT!)

Wait **30 seconds** for everything to initialize, then check:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

**All services should show "Up":**
```
NAME                  STATUS
academic_backend      Up
academic_postgres     Up
academic_redis        Up
academic_n8n          Up
academic_pgadmin      Up
```

If any show "starting" or "unhealthy", wait another 30 seconds.

---

### Step 6: Seed the Database

This adds sample academic papers for testing:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend python /data/seed_sources.py
```

**What you'll see:**
```
Loading sample academic sources...
Connecting to database...
Processing 1/10: Deep Learning: Methods and Applications
Processing 2/10: Climate Change and Global Warming
...
Successfully inserted 10 academic sources!
```

**If you get an error**, wait 30 more seconds and try again.

---

### Step 7: Test if Backend is Working

Open your web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8000/health
```

**You should see:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "academic-assignment-helper"
}
```

‚úÖ **If you see this, your backend is working!**

---

### Step 8: See the API Documentation

Open your browser to:

```
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

You'll see a nice interface showing all available endpoints:
- `/auth/register` - Create account
- `/auth/login` - Login
- `/upload` - Upload assignment
- `/analysis/{id}` - Get results
- `/sources` - Search papers

**This is your API!** You can click on any endpoint to test it.

---

## üß™ Testing Your Backend (The Easy Way)

I've created a test script that does everything automatically!

### Run the Test Script

```bash
python test_api.py
```

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Checks if backend is healthy
2. ‚úÖ Creates a test student account
3. ‚úÖ Logs in and gets authentication token
4. ‚úÖ Creates a sample assignment file
5. ‚úÖ Uploads the assignment
6. ‚úÖ Waits for analysis
7. ‚úÖ Retrieves and displays results
8. ‚úÖ Searches for relevant academic sources

**What you'll see:**
```

Machine Learning Essay

Introduction:
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables
computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
This essay explores the fundamental concepts.

Deep Learning:
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to process
complex patterns in data. Applications include image recognition
and natural language processing.

Conclusion:
Machine learning continues to advance rapidly with new applications
emerging across all industries.
```

Then in the API docs:
1. Click on `POST /upload`
2. Click "Try it out"
3. Click "Choose File" and select your `my_assignment.txt`
4. Click "Execute"
5. **Save the `assignment_id` from the response!**

### 6. Get Analysis

1. Click on `GET /analysis/{assignment_id}`
2. Click "Try it out"

## ‚ùì Common Problems & Solutions

### Problem: "Cannot connect" error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker ps

# If not, open Docker Desktop and wait for it to start
```

### Problem: "Port already in use"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Start again
docker-compose up -d
```

### Problem: Backend shows "unhealthy"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what's wrong
docker-compose logs backend

# Usually just need to wait longer or restart
docker-compose restart backend
```

### Problem: "seed_sources.py" fails

**Causes:**
1. Database not ready yet
2. Wrong Gemini API key

**Solution:**
```bash
# Wait 30 seconds, then try again
sleep 30
docker-compose exec backend python /data/seed_sources.py

# Check your .env file has correct API key
cat .env | grep GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### Problem: Analysis never completes

**Solution:**
1. Check n8n is running: `http://localhost:5678`
2. Make sure workflow is ACTIVATED (green toggle)
3. Check credentials are configured correctly

### Problem: "command not found: docker-compose"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Try with dash instead
docker compose up -d

# Or install docker-compose
pip install docker-compose
```
