    Machine Learning in Modern Computing

    Introduction:
    Machine learning has revolutionized the field of computer science and artificial intelligence.
    This assignment explores the fundamental concepts of machine learning, including supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

    Supervised Learning:
    Supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled training data. Common algorithms include
    linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. These methods
    are widely used in applications such as image recognition, spam detection, and predictive
    analytics.

    Deep Learning:
    Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple
    layers. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at image processing, while Recurrent
    Neural Networks (RNNs) are effective for sequential data like text and speech.

    Applications:
    Machine learning is applied across various domains including healthcare (disease diagnosis),
    finance (fraud detection), autonomous vehicles, natural language processing, and
    recommendation systems.

    Conclusion:
    As computing power increases and datasets grow larger, machine learning continues to advance,
    enabling more sophisticated AI applications that impact society in profound ways.
