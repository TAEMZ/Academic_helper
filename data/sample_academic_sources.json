    "authors": "Li Deng, Dong Yu",
    "publication_year": 2014,
    "abstract": "This book provides an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas include natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing.",
    "full_text": "Deep learning has emerged as a new area of machine learning research. It aims to move machine learning closer to one of its original goals: artificial intelligence. Deep learning is about learning multiple levels of representation and abstraction that help to make sense of data such as images, sound, and text. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones.",
